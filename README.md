## Features
1. User can select the length and requirements for a password.
2. Once the generate password button is clicked, the a random password is generated.
3. User can click the copy button to copy the password in the generated password textarea.

## User Story
As a user who is constantly reusing the same passowrd and getting hack, I would like an application that will allow me to quickly generate a new password for each site. This will help prevent all my accounts being hacked simultaneously. 

## Clone Repository
* git clone https://github.com/ManoLo2ManoLo/Password-Generator.git

### Password Requirements
Length: This is a input box that accepts only numbers. (8 - 128)<br />
Lowercase: This is a checkbox, if it is checked off, it will add lowercase character to the password.<br />
Uppercase: This is a checkbox, if it is checked off, it will add uppercase character to the password.<br />
Numeric: This is a checkbox, if it is checked off, it will add numeric character to the password.<br />
Special: This is a checkbox, if it is checked off, it will add special character to the password.<br />

<br />

If the user does not select any of the character requirement, an error message will appear advising the user to select a character requirement.<br />
If the user does not type a number in the length, or type a number that is within the parameter (8 - 128), an error message will appear advising them to type a valid number.
